The following new test case has been added:
findBoundStates.F90: The code takes standard input from MST and calculates the energy eigenvalues of the bound states in the range
                     of (-10.0Ryd, 0.0Ryd) and calculates the charge density associated with the states
Todo: The calculated charge desities show (2,0) and (2,1) components, likely due to some numerical issues arising from the quandratic 
      expansion of the Jost matrix. It needs to be checked. The code for calculating the density associated with the bound state appears 
      to be correct algebracally (checked agaist getDOS function from SSSolverModule for e > 0). It also needs to check the symmetry of the
      regular solution and sine matrix when e < 0, and compare the symmetry to the e > 0 case.
