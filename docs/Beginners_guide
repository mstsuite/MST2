============
1. bin/lsms2.0:
An obsolete LSMS code.

2. bin/mst2.1:
The current working code (main: src/mst2.1.F90), capable of performing the ab 
initio electronic structure calculation for 3-d structures. 
Its features include:
   * Linear scaling calculation based on LSMS method
   * Calculations based on KKR method
   * Muffin-tin potential
   * Full-potential
   * Non-relativistic
   * Scalar-relativistic
   * Relativistic (muffin-tin potential only)
   * Non-spin polarized/spin-polarized/spin-canted
   * Lloyd formula for determining the Fermi energy
   * Special k-points method for BZ integration
   * LDA/LSDA for the exchange-correlation potentials
Input files:
   * i_* file: The main input file which contains the controling parameters
     for running the SCF calculation and the parameters defining the system
   * info_* file: The actual file name is specifiled in the i_* file. It
     contains atom based controling parameters
   * position data file: The actual file name is specified in the i_* file.
   * potential file(s): The actual file name and format is specified in the
     info_* file.
   * kmeshs.inp: This is an optional input file, only used for the testing 
     purpose.
   * emeshs.inp: This is an optional input file, only used for the testing
     purpose.
Output files:
   * o_n000* file: This file contains the major output information. Note that
     it will not be created if the output is instructed (in the i_* input file)
     to be printed out to the screen.
   * k_n000* file: This file contains a brief information of the total energy
     and the Fermi energy from each SCF iteration
   * new potential file: The actual file name and format is specified in the
     info_* file.

3. bin/ssk:
A driver code (main: driver/SingleSiteKrein.F90) for src/SSSolverModule.F90, a 
Fortran-90 module for solving the single site scattering matrices and wave
functions.
Its features include:
   * Muffin-tin potential
   * Full-potential
   * Non-relativistic
   * Scalar-relativistic
   * Partial and total phase shifts as function of energy
   * DOS and integrated DOS inside/outside of an atomic cell
Input files: The same as those used for mst.2.1.
   * i_* file: The main input file which contains the controling parameters.
   * info_* file: The actual file name is specifiled in the i_* file. It
     contains atom based controling parameters
   * position data file: The actual file name is specified in the i_* file.
   * potential file(s): The actual file name and format is specified in the
     info_* file.
   * emeshs.inp: This is an optional input file, only used for the testing
     purpose.
Output files: Note that the file name contains the information of the angular
momentum cut-offs and the energy mesh size.
   * smd_*: The file contains the general total and partial phase shifts 
     obtained from the S-matrix.
   * del_*: The file contains the DOS and the integrated DOS calculated from
     the Krein formula and Green function formula.
   * DOS_*: In somewhat different format, the data are essentially the same as
     that contained in del_* file.
   * dos_*: In somewhat different format, the data are essentially the same as
     that contained in del_* file.
