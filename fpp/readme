fpp - Fortran preprocessor

sources from http://netlib.org/fortran/
for license information etc have a look in the original .tgz files



original file: fdfpp.tgz, makefile has been modified (gnu makefile style)
how to build:
   - cd src
   - edit makefile accordingly (should work if you have gcc and yacc)
   - make



alternatively you can use a minor variant of fdfpp using autoconf: fdfpp-martin.tgz
   - untar it
   - ./configure
   - make
