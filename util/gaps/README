gaps.h:
	A header file containing a few macros and function prototypes for gaps.c.
radii.c:
	This file contains an array mapping elements to their atomic radii.
	The values for the radii are as of the time of editing, the ones found in:
		Slater, J C. "Atomic Radii in Crystals." Journal of Chemical Physics. 
			41.10 (1964): Print.
	The list must end in NAN or -NAN.

	Note: when updating values, cite the source in a comment after the value
		ex.		/* H  */  0.25, /* Slater */
	
	The values can be changed if needed by passing a -r "Z=A" argument:
		ex. to change Hydrogen (atomic number 1) to a radius of 0.34 Angstroms,
			./gaps -r "1=0.34" -i /path/to/input
	If a -g flag is used, then they are automatically changed to whatever
	allows them to fit in the crystal, no matter how they have been redefined
	up to that point.
structs.h:
	keeps all of the structs used in the program
fill.h:
	function prototypes for fill.c
gapslib.h:
	Contains macros and function prototypes that are used in multiple places.
symbols.c:
	Contains an array of atomic symbols for lookup purposes on input. The last
	element in the list must be NULL.
gapslib.c:
	Contains helper functions for both gaps.c and fill.c
gaps.c:
	The main file containing the UI and I/O code.
fill.c:
	The file containing all of the filling algorithms
gaps.1:
	The man page for gaps. You may view it with "man ./gaps.1"
draw.py:
	A program that creates a 3d image out of the output of gaps.
makefile:
	The makefile.

To install:
	Check the makefile to ensure that BINDIR is the directory you wish to 
	install in and MANDIR the directory that man pages are stored in (one of
	the outputs of manpath).
	To install, the only necessary command is:
		$ sudo make install
	If, on the other hand you do not wish to actually install it then the only
	command needed is
		$ make all
