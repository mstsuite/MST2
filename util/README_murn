Documentation for Murnaghan Fit Code

Content of this archive 
murn.f - the source code of the Fit-Program 
murn_zero.f - the source code of the fit-code, including zero-point vibrations 

What does it do? 
The murn.x code fits any given pairs of a_lat/Energy to the Murnaghan Equation
of state and calculates the equilibrium lattice constant and the bulk modulus. 

How to build the executable?
    f90 -o murn.x murn.f 
The code does not need any external libraries, so it should compile 
cross-platform.

How to setup an input file?
The general syntax for the murn.f- input is 
3  : unit of energy for input values (1=Rydberg, 2=EV, 3 = Hartree)  
0.25  : i.e. volume of unit cell/cell used  
7.3 8 50  : minimal/maximal value for lattice const., number of points to 
            calculate (30-50 will do it)  
11  number of alat/Energy pairs  
1 0.2  : alat /energy (11 pairs, each pair at a single line)  

How to run it?
    murn.x <inputfile > outputfile 
The output file is self-explaining

Whats the difference between murn_zero.f and murn.f ? 
The murn_zero.f offers the posibility to calculate the zero-point energy. 
It needs additional input at line 4 of the inputfile. You have to provide, 
the Grueneisen-constant, the Debye-Temperature and the atomic Volume at the 
Debye temperature. 
The syntax is: 
3  : unit of energy for input values (1=Rydberg, 2=EV, 3 = Hartree)  
0.25  : i.e. volume of unit cell/cell used  
7.3 8 50  : minimal/maximal value for lattice const., number of points to 
            calculate (30-50 will do it)  
.true. 2.19 428 109.9  : calculate zero-point vibrations (true), 
                         Grueneisen constant, T(Debye), Volume/atom for 
                         T(Debye)  
11  : number of alat/Energy pairs  
1 0.2  : alat /energy (11 pairs, each pair at a single line)  


Note: This code has only been tested for fcc-Al! 

Some values for other materials: Gamma  T(Debye)  Volume/atom for T(Debye) 
Al: 2.19  428 109.9 
Fe: 1.66 467  78.95 
Cu:  2.00 343 78.92 

What kind of strange things can happen? 
The code is pretty reliable, however with some strange input parameters it can 
not properly perform the interpolation. The way it reports this error is by 
giving NaNQ in the output. It happened while calculating Al, using 
nlcc-Pseudopots at some nlcc-radii and at low cutoff-energies. 
Check the form of your parabola, sometimes it has "2 minima" and the min/max 
finder does not find the global one.
