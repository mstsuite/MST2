The following input data is an example for using MST2/bin/genap to generate a 
Fe(0.25)Al(0.75) alloy sample with FCC underlying lattice (a0=3.50 Angstrom), 
256 atomic sites in total by repeating a FCC cubic cell 4 times along each of
x, y, and z directions, and 4 desired short range parameters: 
0.25, -0.10, -0.05, 0.15, each of which is given equal importance weight. 

The sample is generated by placing 256 atoms (with appropriate content of Fe 
and Al) randomly on 256 atomic sites and swapping atoms to reach desired SROs 
via a simulated annealing method. The annealing process starts from 2000 K and 
cools down at 5 K per step. The generated sample data is saved to a file called
AlFe-sample.dat in VASP POSCAR direct format.
